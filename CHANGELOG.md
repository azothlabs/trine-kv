All public crate releases use Semantic Versioning.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-26

Initial packaged release candidate for the embedded LSM MVCC engine.

### Added

- Embedded LSM MVCC key-value database with in-memory and persistent modes.
- Built-in default bucket plus optional named buckets, point reads/writes,
  range scans, prefix scans, snapshots, optimistic transactions, and atomic
  write batches.
- WAL recovery, SSTable flush/read, manifest metadata, leveled compaction,
  block compression through `lz4_flex`, prefix filters, block cache stats, and
  Titan-like blob files for large values.
- Value-lazy range and prefix iterators for large-value workloads that need
  keys before reading blob bytes.
- Automatic blob Level Merge policy and snapshot-safe blob GC with batched
  stale-file rewriting.
- Read-only open, safe temporary file repair policy, durability notes, usage
  guide, quickstart examples, integration examples, release checklist, and
  benchmark baselines.

### Hardened

- Manifest publish installs in-memory state only after durable file publish
  succeeds.
- WAL, manifest, and table decoders reject impossible count fields before large
  allocation.
- Failed flush/compaction publish removes unpublished table/blob output files.
- Recovery validates referenced table/blob files and fails closed on missing or
  corrupt storage files.
